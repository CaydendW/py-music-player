# py-music-player

Documentation in the program. Just hit 'h' and enter in the cmd line and see the instructions.

This program works by using python to automate the usage of mpv + youtube-dl. It also has support for playlists via JSON storage files and downloads are coming soon.  
It works on a CLI and looks and feels pretty basic. It also has some command line arguements (with the help of argparse)  
I also have a requirements.txt for easy install of dependencies via pip.
